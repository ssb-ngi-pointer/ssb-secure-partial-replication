# identity converstion / ssb | 2021-04-08

Agenda:
- mini topics
  - private groups + ssb-db2
    - bug : if you don't have group root (mix hasn't done anything)
    - arj has done a PR updating to latest master branch
      - turned up some errors with indexes
      - pairing?
      - might come back to it?
        - is this going to be supported by the end of this grant?

  - NGI updates?
    - had a call with zenna/ magnus/ martin

- identity across multiple devices?
  - spec?
- feedless identity (mvsa)
- structure (did documents)

## design constraints/ problem

arj:
- scared of sameAs because lots of people have spent time and not made much progress
- wanted to do something very simple
  - started out with linking identities
- realised some requirements:
  - want to be able to send / receive private messages
- NOT:
  - create a identity which is not a key, so you can cycle keys
  - no adding / removing members of identity, you would just mint a new thing
  
  
mix:
- support:
  - laptop + phone + desktop all can be used "the same"
  - one profile for all
    1. can mention "Mix"
    2. can private message with "Mix"
    3. can use "Mix" in authorisation logic (e.g. add mix as a gathering admin) :fire:
        - is this edit coming in "part of Mix" and should I include
    4. can add "Mix" to private groups :fire:
        - what happens when a new device get added to "mix"
        - what happens when a device gets removed from "mix"
  - no "ONE MASTER KEY TO RULE THEM ALL" :fire:
    5. any device can nullify the union

topics:

### A. adding device to an identity
   - is it one identity?
   - is it a thing which changes over time?
   - is it important to be able to reference a point in time for an identity?
 
if we tombstone an identity then it allows us to not have to reason about removing people
if we mint a new identity, then we know we can trust that....
so there's time with the identity, but it's not a continuous morphing thing, but discrete progression.

one way we could cut off the line of what's valid is a list of sequences for each feed where we make a cut.

tombstone
- records the latest sequence of the participating feeds known...

tangling the feeds
- if we force a "previous" for each identity, then we can partial ordering

summary:
- you can add add add
- you cannot remove
- you can tombstone

   
### B. what's after a tombstone

ideas:
- create a new identity with a previous which points back
  - no: mixing concerns (connecting identities + definining identity)
- redirect message
  - can store dedicated meta data
  - you can point at the redirect distinctly and
    - attest things
    - mutate it (e.g. tombstone)
  - attestation on redirect (or something)
- create one or more identities, other people will decide how to proceed
  - attestation : people recording their decision

questions:
- how can we seperate concerns as much as possible
- should the tombstone also be a redirect?
  - arj: against (mix agree)
- what was associated with this identity?
  - a record of which feeds are included?
  - some meta data
    - name
  - private messaging key
  - unique ID
  
  - holds group keys which it has access to
  - signing key????
  
- how do other people know what to trust?
  - attestation
- how do others assert trust in a successor?
  - attestation
  
- what happens with groups? :fire: :poop: :dragon:
  - the group key has to change
    1. wreck the group
    2. cycle the key
    
  - "I actually don't think it will be that hard"
    - arj on infintely nested identities/ groups
    
  - want something similar to a "normal feed"
    - have a public key which can be referenced
    - maybe you don't need to care about whether you're addessing a "normal" or "sameAs"

scenario of mix losing his phone and being part of a the ssbc group:
1. mix loses phone
2. mix tombstones identity
3. mix/ someone tombstones the ssbc group
4. someone posts a redirect to new group
5. we all have to jump :hand waving:



## Lens

Do you really trust this person?
- if you do, you can be less paranoid.


## Next time

- start writing details
  - rework the same-as spec repo
- check in on ssb-crut assumptions
